    After graduation, I joined the Indico team at CERN to rewrite Indico's complete codebase. While taking care of frontend, backend, DevOps, user support, and documentation tasks, my main focus was on UX improvements, introducing multiple reusable interface components for a more coherent UI. I also implemented the <a href="https://getindico.io/">project's website</a> and built a <a href="https://github.com/indico/indico-styleguide">styleguide</a> for the whole web app.
