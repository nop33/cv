    After graduating from university I joined the Indico team at CERN where we rewrote Indico's complete codebase. While dealing with both backend and frontend tasks as well as DevOps, user support and documentation, my main focus was on UX improvements, introducing multiple reusable interface components for a more coherent UI. During my employment there I also implemented the project's website and built a styleguide for the whole application.
