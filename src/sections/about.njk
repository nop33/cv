      <p>Through my 13 years of experience in web development, I have acquired a wide range of technical and human skills. My colleagues and superiors consistently recognize my natural organizational skills. The designers I work with appreciate my obsessive accuracy when bringing their designs to life. The last 4 years I've been focusing on building high-performance UIs as the core maintainer of the Alephium frontend monorepo. <a href="https://github.com/alephium/alephium-frontend/" target="_blank"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></p>
